# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers into clusters based on their behavior and characteristics, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics. By doing so, businesses can:
- Personalize marketing efforts.
- Improve customer satisfaction.
- Increase revenue through targeted campaigns.

This project uses the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to identify distinct customer groups in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer information such as:
- **Demographic data** (e.g., age, gender, income).
- **Behavioral data** (e.g., purchase history, product preferences).

The dataset is preprocessed to ensure quality insights:
- Handling missing values.
- Scaling features for distance-based clustering.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and scaling the data.
2. **Choosing the Number of Clusters**:
   - Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. **Clustering**:
   - Applying the K-Means algorithm to group customers.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizing clusters in 2D using PCA for better interpretability.
5. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzing cluster characteristics to extract business insights.

## Results

- Customers were grouped into **X distinct clusters** based on their behavior and characteristics.
- Key insights from clusters:
  - **Cluster 1**: High-income individuals with frequent purchases.
  - **Cluster 2**: Budget-conscious customers with infrequent purchases.
  - **Cluster 3**: Young customers with a preference for certain product categories.
